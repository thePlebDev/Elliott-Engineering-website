## About

This is a passion project of mine. My goal is to make free, aforadable and open source software for rural communities. Rual communities have historically been shut out and denied access to simple software products that are desparately needed in todays modern era. With this project I dream to one day offer an entire sotware library of applications and software tools to rural comminuties.

## Tech stack

- The website is powered on the frontend by [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) on the backend and [Android](https://developer.android.com/) for the first mobile application.


## Products
- Currently there is only one active product and that is the [Calving tracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.elliottSoftware.ecalvingtracker&hl=en&gl=US). This is a free Android app specifically created to aid cattle farmers during calving season(when baby cows are born). It currently has 6 down loads and that is something I say with great price. Versions 2 of the application is currently under development.
